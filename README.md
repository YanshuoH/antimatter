## Story
Collisions between matter and antimatter lead to the annihilation of both, which produce about 3 orders of magnitude greater than the nuclear potential energy that can be liberated.

So you must **save the world** from this collision by **seperating your cursor (made of antimatter) from the particles (matter)**.
